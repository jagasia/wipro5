HTML
	What is HTML?
HyperText Markup Language

The first markup language, i learnt was SGML	(Standard Generalized Markup Language)
	SGML had huge predefined tags (vocabulary) and also
		allowed us to define our own tags.	(like XML)

A subset of SGML called HTML 

What is a web page?
	a page that can be viewed in any browser, is a web page.

Can you create a webpage and view it in web browser without using HTML?
	applets
		to be able to view applet in browser
		<applet> </applet>		is a html tag
	servlets
		text or html code is used
		output generated by servlet is html


HTML is very import for a web application

learning html is very easy if you understand the basics of a markup language

1) tags are also called as elements
	ex:
		<html>	is the root element of a html page
		<head> and <body> are two containers inside html. All other elements are inside either of these two only

2) there are different types of elements
	i) empty element
		ex:
			<br/>
			<hr/>
can you see that i type a / at the end?
	this is defined in SGML.	But today modern programmers do not follow this, but still it works.
when you work in ReactJs, you use jsx where these rules are strict. Else you will warning

	ii) content tag
		they can have
			start tag
			end tag

	nesting is allowed and must be proper
	proper nesting

	ex:
		<b><i>Hello world</b></i>	here, the nesting is not done properly
	it should be
		<b><i>Hello world</i></b>	this is correct

3) attributes
	attributes provide additional information to the element
	<p align="right">This is a paragraph that will be displayed in right alignment</p>

here, "p" is an element and "align" is an attribute
"right" is the value for the attribute

the value for an attribute must always be supplied in double quotes only (no matter if it is number or text)

ex:
	<table border="1">

note that "1" is also in double quotes. 
This is because, HTML is a text based markup language
and everything is character in this language

4) entities
	suppose if we need to print an expression like:
		a<b>c
now, what is the problem in printing this above expression?
the greater than symbol is confused with a starting tag

a bold c rather than a<b>c		< and > are not considered as characters

so, it should be
		a&lt;b&gt;c

here
	&lt;	is	<
	&gt;	is	>
	&nbsp;	is 	space
	&amp;	is	&

These are called as entities.

5) in any markup language, a document must have only 1 root element

all other elements are inside that root element

<html>
</html>
<html>
</html>
	the above is not possible



UTF-8
	is commonly used encoding

what is encoding?
	is a numeric equivalent for a character
	A = 65
	a = 97
	0 = 48

a set of characters and corresponding numeric equivalent is called a character set and encoding scheme

ASCII		8 bit char set		
Unicode		16 bit char set
in unicode, the first 8 bit is called as UTF-8			Unicode Text Format 8 bit


Learning HTML includes identifying as many tags (elements) present in html language.

some of the important html elements to learn:
	headings
	paragraph
	list
		bullets	(unordered)
		numbered	(ordered)
	table
	form	(input)
	

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>1</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

Writing html code in visual studio code, itself is an art.
in cloud lab, vs code is installed already

in vs code, open a folder (ex:	html is the folder i created now)
in that folder, create a file
	one.html

since the file extension is "html", vs code will help me with html syntax

and lot of short cuts that makes our code more productive.

example:

doc<enter>

how i create div whose id is div1?
	#div1<enter>

div whose class is div2?
	.div2<enter>

paragraph with id p1?
	p#p1

input:text

input:button

somebody told about "live server" in the morning

<input type="text" name="" id="">

there are some elements work as group. So they will have same name. Same name makes it same group.
Id is always unique among all elements of a document. Two elements in a document cannot have same id.


HTML elements are meant for presentation. Whatever we write decides how this element is displayed.
but name, id, such attributes are used for identification purpose 


difference between 
	radio button
	check box

dropdownlist
	select

bullets
	unordered list
		how to change the style from dark round to white round, box etc
	ordered list
		i) 
		ii)
		1)
		2)
		a)
		b)
		A)
		B)

	how to start the list from 5 instead of 1?

Task:
create html page using visual studio code.
practise html in w3schools html page and do the same in vs code
using shortcuts
