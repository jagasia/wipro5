HOC
Understanding HOC Concepts, Implementing simple HOC Component.

HOC is useful for 
	cross cutting
	decorator pattern

Suppose, if you have created a withdrawal component/ deposit component/ print last 10 transaction
these components, can be accessed only if the user has already logged in
or while accessing these components, it should prompt the user to login.

So, those who create these components do not bother about before and after things to be done.
I create withdrawal component.
But someone who uses this component, has to take care - what needs to be done before and after

this is what cross cutting is all about. We discussed this during spring AOP.

now, instead of just plugging the withdrawal component into my App component,
I can decorate/ cover/ enclose this component inside a HOC

HOC is going to wrap my component while plugging it in App component.
