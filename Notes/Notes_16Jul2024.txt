Day #31
-----------
we created a json server for products

http://localhost:4000/products

i have shown you example for
	POST		add product to the server
	GET		all products and display in tabular format

i asked you to complete
	PUT
	DELETE

Today, I have completed them also.

Form handling includes form validation also.

there should be some rules for each attribute 
	id	cannot be negative or zero
	name	First letter must be capital, and atleast there should be 3 letters, no numbers
	price	cannot be negative or zero

How to do you validate these information?
when do you want to show error messages?

if they leave the textbox, it can validate		blur
when we enter the data itself it can validate		keyup
first time, when they enter the data, it should wait,



{idError && <div className="text-danger">{idError}</div>}

Task:

Create a signup form 
and introduce form validations.


----------------------------------------------------
What is routing?
	in reactjs, we do not create pages. we create components

	so, how can we navigate/ show component in a particular area of another component?

1) routing must be installed in our project
	npm i react-router-dom

2) in index.js
	notice that App is plugged
		<App />

cover this App by browser router
<BrowserRouter>
      <App />
</BrowserRouter>

3) where do we want to render the components?
	in App component, we choose a location
	ideally, middle column of three columns

for this demo, i have created a new project
	router-demo

in App component

      <Routes>
        <Route path='/' element={<Home />}></Route>
        <Route path='/about' element={<About />}></Route>
        <Route path='/contact' element={<Contact />}></Route>
      </Routes>

create a Nav component
and update the hyper links to
	/
	/about
	/contact
	/about

plug the Nav in App

Task:
create a new react js application
install the following
	bootstrap
	react-router-dom
create few components
and create a nav component
in app component rended the corresponding component according the link clicked in nav
