Git
	we used git to share our project with other collaborators
	we created a github repository (remote repository)
	we created a folder in our system (local repository)
	we were able to push files and folders from local to the remote repository
	how?
		we initialized local repository
			git init
		we linked this local to remote using
			git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/example.git
		we added all files in current location
			git add .
		we committed the changes to local repository
			git commit -m "your message"
		we pushed the changes to remote repository
			git push orgin master
			or
			we create a branch
			git branch -M jag	
			git push -u origin jag

	-m
	-u
	-M
		you need to go through the techademy and also additonal websites to take the maximum
		list of commands and options used in git.

	git merge
	git checkout vs 	git switch
	stashing
	resolved conflict 

	git config --global user.name jagasia
---------------------------------

What is the purpose of using Git?
Which git you have used?
	github
	gitlab
	bitbucket
How do you switch between current branch to another branch
	git checkout
How do you merge your current branch with another branch
	when there are conflicts
		resolve conflict and merge
		and delete another branch
Suppose, your team of 4 members want to work on a single remote repository
	how do you allow other 3 members to push to your repository?
		make them as collaborators

Java as a technology includes
	Java Platform
	Java language


Java Platform includes
	java compiler
		that is used to translate a java program into a byte code
	java runtime environment	
		that is used to execute / run the program


a platform usually is used to develop applications
	applications => application software


what kind of applications/ services can be developed using java?
	console applications		CUI		Character User Interface
	windows applications		GUI		Graphical User Interface
	web applications		use browser to access the applications
	web services / microservices	no frontend	datasource and business logic
	mobile applications		GUI
	
we can also create components in java which are called as "Java Beans" which can be plugged into other java applications to be able to run them.

Java introduced in 1995 by Sun Microsystems 
a team lead by James Gosling (Sun Microsystems) developed 
	initially they developed 	a language called "Oak" (it is a kind of tree)
	later they named it as		Java	(it is coffee in indonesia)


Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia

Java versions:
	1.1
	1.2
	1.3
	1.4
		major version change		happened in 5
	5		for-each loop, Arrays methods like toString, Generics. Annotations
	6
	7
		major version change		happened in 8
	8	Lambda, Stream api, Functional programming, Method reference
	9	Concurrency

	11	

	17
	21
	22
	
	six month once, you can expect a version. but there is something called LTS
	Long Term Support 
		that allows us to use a version without worrying about the new version


Lab setup:
--------------
java can be downloaded and installed (free for non commercial use)

But we use cloud lab.

Task:
-------
	Open cloud lab
	go to cmd in any location
	check java version
		java -version
		(or)
		java --version


since most of us get error loading cloud lab,
Let us use CODE LAB

A java program cannot execute without a class and main method

so, in code lab,
write the following code:

public class App
{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello jag");
    }
}

click the "Compile and run" button
