HTML & CSS
-------------------
We are going to finish HTML & CSS today.

What is frontend?
	whatever user interface/ presentation/ view/ input output etc
	are called as frontend.

When we created MVC projects, of course, "view" is front end. That means, mvc projects have frontend also.
Except that, whatever we learned so far, was related to backend development

Backend means, something that runs in "Server".

what is client server?
	client is used for input and output or presentation or view etc
	client is frontend or frontend is viewed in client
	sometimes front end runs in client

	JSP is always UI or frontend. JSP is meant for presentation or view
	Servlets can be used as view or controller. (mostly controller)

	JSP, Servlets when they act as view, they run at server and produce output that are sent to browser. they are front end but server side.
	
	server side script means a program that runs in server and produce output that are displayed in browser.
	they produce output or not. they are displayed or not. but they are scripts that are capable for computation / calculation / validation or something

client side scripts
	javascript
	vbscript

these are programs sent to browser and run in browser itself.
	(provided they are not restricted by the browser)

server side scripts
	servlet
	jsp
	asp
	php

these are programs run in server and then send the output to browser


example:
------------
	if you print the time using a script,
		client side script is used to print a time means,
			it prints the client computer time
		server side script is used to print a time means,
			it prints the server computer time

Facebook.com
	the web pages are present in server.
	not in my computer.
	when i visit facebook.com, the web pages 
		comes from server to my computer browser
		my computer becomes a client now

	
----------------------

HTML is not scripting language.
	it is a markup language meant for presentation

a data can be displayed in browser using html
html elements decide how to print that data in browser.

<b>	bold
<i>	italic
<u>	underline
<h1>	largest heading
<h6>	smallest heading
<ul>
	<li>India</li>
	<li>Pakistan</li>
</ul>

CSS
	styling the html elements using Cascading Style Sheet

Bootstrap
	is an application of css
	somebody has done lot of style definitions using css
	

table
heading
paragraph
form input
list
	unorderd
	ordered

in html, style is an attribute

attributes:
	id
	class
	style
	
<p style="text-align: center;color:blue;background-color:aquamarine;">This is a paragraph</p>    


Task:
---------
Kindly complete practise of HTML in all the topics 


CSS
------
Before CSS was introduced or became popular, i was doing all the formatting /styling in html itself.
If you want to change
	color
	background color
	alignment
	
etc
all these styling or formatting were done in html itself.


CSS - Cascading StyleSheet

is introduced for styling, so i was thinking what is the advantage of using CSS?

CSS adds style to html pages.
but when i can do the styling in html language itself, what is advantage of using css?


suppose, i have 10 html pages. All these pages must look consistent.
if i use html based styling, them i have to repeat the styling in all the 10 pages.
if any change is decided, then i have to repeat the change everywhere.

ex:

	<p align="right">....</p>
	<p align="right">....</p>
	<p align="right">....</p>


if we need to change this alignments to center

	<p alight="center">....</p>
	<p alight="center">....</p>
	<p alight="center">....</p>
	<p alight="center">....</p>


if i use css:

p
{
	text-align:right;
}

<p>.....</p>		i am not styling in html
<p>.....</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>.....</p>




if i want paragraph align to center

p
{
	text-align:center;
}


<p>.....</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>.....</p>
can you see that, a change happen in one location reflect everywhere.


in 2009, i worked in a company as webapp developer
i create form input elements and 
there was another team for aesthetics. They are good in CSS
they give me a css file that i apply in my webpages.
when i run the code, it looks so nice.
I dont bother styling my webpages. That is taken care by another team

benefit of css?
	separate the roles of web designer and developer.
	designer work on css
	developer work on html

we an use css in 3 ways:	(interview question also)
	inline
	internal
	external

inline:
	css styling is applied on an element using 
	the style applies to the current element only.
		style attribute
		<p style="color:blue;text-align:center">this is paragraph</p>

internal:
	css styling is applied to the current document only
		style element

	<style>
		p
		{
			color:blue;
			text-align:center;
		}
	</style>
	<p>this is a paragraph</p>		style is applied to all paragraphs in the current document

external:
	css styling is applied to all documents where this css file is imported
	a separate .css file is created and referred in required html files using
		<link> element




example for inline:	(style attribute)
-------------------------
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
<p style="color:red">THis is para 1</p>    
<p>this is second paragraph</p>
<p style="color:aqua">Third para</p>
</body>
</html>


example for internal:	(style element)
-----------------------------
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        p{
            text-align: center;
            color:yellow;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>THis is a para</p>
    <p style="color:blue">This is second para</p>
    <p>Third para</p>
</body>
</html>

here, internal styling is done using <style> element
it is applied to all elements where selector is matching

but notice the second para. it has inline style also. So, inline overrides, the internal.


example:
external style sheet: (<link>)
lets create orange.css file now:

orange.css:
-----------------
p{
    color:orange
}

h1{
    color:lightgoldenrodyellow
}



five.html
----------------------
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <!-- to apply css file to this doc -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="orange.css">
    
</head>
<body>
    <p>THis is a paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>





notice that
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="orange.css">
is used to apply a css file to a html page.
similarly, for many html pages, we can apply 1 css and 
it will be consistent. A change in 1 css can reflect everywhere

also, we can apply, multiple css files to one html page also.

understand, when external css says "paragraphs should be displayed in orange color"
it is applied. But if internal style says paragraphs in red, then internal wins
if inline is there, inline wins.
what happens if id selector is used? id wins

Selectors:
------------
so far all examples we used uses "element" selector

p		//this is element selector.
{
	color:blue
}


there can be 
	id selector
	class selector


example for id selector:
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <!-- to apply css file to this doc -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="orange.css">
    <style>
        #p1
        {
            color:blue
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>THis is a paragraph</p>
    <p id="p1">THis is second para</p>
</body>
</html>

example for class selector:

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        .xyz
        {
            color:yellow
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<p>one</p>    
<p class="xyz">two</p>
<p>three</p>
<p class="xyz">four</p>
</body>
</html>

here, whichever element has a class "'xyz" is applied with color yellow

it can be para, it can be heading, or anything that  has class=xyz

then it is applied

if we create styling that applies to multiple html pages, then create external css file and apply that in required html pages.
if we create styling that applies only to current web page, then use internal style
if we need to apply style only to a particular element, use inline


Task:
use w3schools css chapter
identify different types of css selectors.

------------------------------------------------

I have created 6 textboxes that you can see in browser.
whenever cursor gets into the textbox, (by click or by tab)
the text box background color should become yellow (so that it will highlight which text box is active now)

what is the selector in css that selects all text boxes?

	        input[type=text] {
            background-color: yellow;
        }

now, this style should apply only when cursor comes to a particular textbox
	we can specify the event on which style must apply.
	what is the event we want to choose?	event is "focus" event

can you say some events?	
	click
	dblclick
	focus
	blur
	keyup
	keydown
	keypress

in js, you might have used
	onclick
	onblur
	onfocus
	onkeyup






<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        input[type=text]:focus {
            background-color: yellow;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <input type="text" name="" id=""><br>
    <input type="text" name="" id=""><br>
    <input type="text" name="" id=""><br>
    <input type="text" name="" id=""><br>
    <input type="text" name="" id=""><br>
    <input type="text" name="" id=""><br>
    <input type="button" value="submit">
</body>
</html>


border
	in css is a combination of 3 border styles


            border-color: blue;
            border-width: 15px;
            border-style: solid;
instead of above 3 lines:
	border: 15px solid blue;



border: 15px solid #ff00ff;

border:15px solid rgb(255,0,0)

background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)
last argument is alpha for transparency.  	between 0 to 1
0.1 being complete transparent
0.9 being no transparent
0 and 1 also allowed
