Java Full stack with ReactJs

front end:
	html
	css
	javascript
	bootstrap
	reactjs

back end:
	microservices using spring boot 



Git
	devops tool
	there are development operations tools
		Git
		Jira
		Jenkins

to manage the development operations
	sharing the code	(git)
	versioning the code	(git)	(multiple programmers work on a single project)

	we need to allocate the task among the developers (jira)
	
	build, run the code and CI/CD pipeline (jenkins)


	GIT
		what are the popular git portals?
			github
			gitlab
			bitbucket

	using these git portals, we can create repositories which can be public or private.

	
1) Lab setup / installation
	to be able to work on git portal, we dont need to install anything
	we can signup to github.com
	and login to github in any computer using a browser.

	But we need to push our files from local system to git 
		we need to install git in our computer and configure it to identify you
		who is pushing the code?
	in local system, how to install git?
	1)	download git from 
			https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.45.2.windows.1/Git-2.45.2-64-bit.exe
	and run the executable to complete the installation.

	2) in github.com, signup (if not already done) 
	
	3) configure you local git:
		git config --global user.name jagasia
		git config --gloabl user.email rjagadeeswaran@Yahoo.com
		git config --list --show-origin

		the above commands can be done in any location in your system cmd prompt.

	
Now, create a repository (remote) in github.com
then choose one folder in your computer as local repository.
	the local repository should not be part of another GIT repository.

		

You have cloud lab

	in cloud lab, git is already installed
		git --version

	git config --global user.name jagasia
	git config --global user.email rjagadeeswaran@yahoo.com

	now, choose a folder in cloud lab. I have chosen

	d:\jag\all
		git init
			this command creates a .git folder and it will remember the commands we execute
			until we commit, until we push, these are recorded in that .git folder
			
			creates a local repository

		git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/wipro5.git
			this command links this local repository with the remote repository
		
		git pull origin jag
			this command pulls all the files and folders available in "jag" branch in remote repository
		
			i use git pull command by being inside the local repository folder
			if i am outside this folder, then i would have used "git clone https://.......git"
				then i have to go inside the folder using 	cd <<foldername>>

			usually, git clone should be used only once
				after that you will push or pull

			git push	is used to upload the changes from local repository to remote repository
			git pull	is used to download the changes from remote repository to local repository



d:\jag\projects
	HRM
		frontend
		backend


Task:
	If not already, 
	Create an account in GitHub.com
	use signup option.
	remember the password.

keep a copy of your git repository URL
	git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/dummy1.git



Task:
	in your local system, you create a folder 
		"training"
	without any files, we cannot push this folder to remote
	create a readme.txt file or any file of your choice

having decided to make a particular folder as "local" repository
	how do you push files and folders from local to remote?

	git init
	git remote add origin <<your git url something ends with .git>>
	git add .	
	git commit -m "your message here"
	git branch -M <<your branch name. can be master or main or yourname>>
	git push -u origin <<branchname>>




1) create a repository in github.com after logging into your account.
2) copy the URL of the remote repository
		https://github.com/jagasia/training.git
3) in local computer, choose one folder as local repository
	d:\jag\training

4) go to cmd prompt in this location
	assuming there are atleast 1 file(s) in this location

commands for 1st time (after installing git)
	i) git config --global  user.email rjagadeeswaran@yahoo.com
	ii) git config --global user.name jagasia

commands for one time (for any local repository)
	i) git init
	ii) git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/training.git
	iii) git add .
	iv) git commit -m "first commit"
	v) git push origin master
		if suppose you want your name as branch then instead of above (v) command
			git branch -M jag
			git push -u origin jag

	first time when you push, it will ask authorization
		you can use browser authorization and come back to cmd prompt and see that it is successful.
	vi) check github and refresh	





henceforth, whenever we add files to local folder,
we just need to repeat
	git add .
	git commit -m "05Jun 12:53"
	git push -u origin jag




suppose i have added 5 files in local folder
but only 1 file i want to upload to remote
	git add <<filename>>
	continue commit and push commands


----------------------------------------------------------------
We have installed git in our computer
we have signed up to github and got an account
	user.name
	user.email
we have created a folder for our training
	in that folder, we initialized git repository	(local repo)

we have pushed the files from local repo to remote repo (github repo)


------------------IN CLOUD LAB---------------we can pull our files from github repo
in cloud lab, the "git" is already installed.
only thing we need to do in cloud lab is
	to configure our user name and email using
		git config --global user.name <<your git username>>
		git config --global user.email <<your gi email>>


	choose a folder in cloud lab.		ideally, d: drive create a folder "training"
		d:\jag\training\all

so that training folder may contain many files but only all is sync to github repo

	git init
	git remote add origin <<.................git>>
	git pull origin <<branchname>>



Task:
	add few more files to local folder
	push them to remote and check in browser
	then, 
		in cloud lab, pull those files to that folder


whenever you want to change the remote origin in your local repository,
	git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/repo2.git

you get a message:
	remote already exists.
so, it is not going to change the remote origin.
	git remote set-url origin <<neworigin>>

or
solution:
	del .git
	y/n 		y

git init
git remote add origin .....
