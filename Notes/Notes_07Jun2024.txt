Arrays
--------
	what is an array?

your answers:
	collection of similar elements
	a set of similar data type
	hold a fixed number of values of a single type
	multiple values of the same type
	datastructure that stores data
	linear data structure
	indexed datastructure

i understand that 
	we can store multiple values/ objects in an array
	when you say array contains elements of only 1 type
		every datastructure is like that only

	onething none of you told is that
		Array keeps elements in contiguous memory locations (continuous, adjacent)
Arrays can be single dimension or multi-dimension

in c, c++, arrays are created like below:
	int arr[10];

in Java:
	int []arr=new int[10];

	2 portions
		i) declaration
		ii) creation		(we need to know the size to create an array)


	new int[10];		i have created an array of type int of size 10
	but this array's reference is not stored in any variable. So it cannot be used later.
------------------------------------------------------------
	int arr[];			//i have declared an array of single dimension of type int.
				//but an array is not yet created.

	arr=new int[10];		//an array is created and its reference is kept in variable "arr"

------------------------------------------------------------
the same can be done in single line also:
	int []arr=new int[10];


	the declaration decides the scope of the variable. 	
	if you declare a variable before for loop, then it is used before and inside and outside for loop
	but if you declare a variable inside for loop, then it is used only inside for loop
		not only for loop, any block		{	}
		scope of the variable is within the block only.

	so we can declare an array earlier
	and then create it later (when we come to know how many elements)


Demo:
Sample Input :
11
2
16
15
2
6
8
10
7
22
4
6


the first input mentions the number of elements in the array
in above example, 11 is the size of the array

if first input is x,
then x number of inputs must be captured from the user.

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class App {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int arr[]=new int[n];
		//get n inputs from the user and store them in arr
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
		}
		
		System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
	}

}

In arrays, 
	we can access any element using its id

	arr[0] refers to the first element of the array

	if the length of the array is n
	then arr[n-1] refers to the last element of the array


	we can find the length of the array using
		arr.length		property

	for example, how will you print all elements of an array?
		i) for loop 
		ii) for each loop
		iii) Arrays.toString(arr) 
			Arrays.deepToString(arr)	if arr is multi dimensional
			these methods were introduced in jdk 1.5 only.	means, jdk 1.4 or earlier do not have 


	Arrays in java are always Jagged arrays
	what is meant by jagged array?
		Jagged means uneven
	ex:
		int arr[][]=new int[10][];		//if you consider first dimension as row and second as column
		we have created 10 rows and each row can be of different number of columns.

		arr[0]	refers to the first row		you can see that arr[0] is a single dimensional array


	arr[][]	is like array of arrays

		arr[0]=new int[10];			//first row is having 10 columns
		arr[1]=new int[5];			//second row has 5 columns
		arr[2]=new int[7];			//third row has 7 columns

	this is what we call it as Jagged array.

	if you do not want jagged array, then you want all rows to have same number of columns
		int arr[][]=new int[10][5];		//all rows have same number of columns. Not jagged

	int i=20;
	when you see i is primitive type
	int arr[]=new int[10];		//is complete
	Date d=new Date();
		d is object type

	for objects we need to use new operator



	Date dob;		//this is incomplete
	dob=new Date();	//it is complete now.

	similarly
	Date []dt=new Date[10];			//this is incomplete
	dt[0]=new Date();
	dt[1]=new Date();
	...
	...
	...
	dt[9]=new Date();		

Task:
create an array of size 10
accept 10 inputs from the user and store them in the array
find the largest element and smallest element of the array.
print them as output.


Challenge:
----------------
Run Length IV
 
Write a program to find the length of the longest running sequence of even numbers in the given array. Also find the starting index of the longest running sequence of even numbers.
 
Example :
 
Consider the array ... { 2, 16, 15, 2, 6, 8, 10, 7, 22, 4 , 6}
 
The 3 even number sequences in this array are {2, 16}, {2, 6, 8, 10} and {22, 4, 6}.
The longest running even number sequence is {2, 6, 8, 10}
The length of the longest running even number sequence is 4 and the starting index is 3.
 
Note:
The array indexing starts from 0.
If there are multiple choices, select the choice where the starting index is minimum.
 
Input and Output Format:
 
The first line of the input consists of an integer n that corresponds to the number of elements in the array. The next 'n' lines of input consists of a single integer that correspond to the elements in the array.
 
The first line of the output consists of the length of the longest running even number sequence and the second line of the output consists of the starting index of the longest running even number sequence.
 
Sample Input :
11
2
16
15
2
6
8
10
7
22
4
6
 
Sample Output :
4
3

Hint:
-------
what is an even number?
	a number which is greater than 0 and is divisible by 2 is an even number

	if(arr[i]%2==0)
	{
		//even  number	
	}
import java.util.Scanner;

public class App4_Longest {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int arr[]=new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
		}
		///we have got all inputs
		int count=0;
		int maxCount=0;
		int startIndex=-1;
		int maxStartIndex=-1;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			if(arr[i]%2==0)
			{
				System.out.println(arr[i]);
				count++;
				if(count==1)
				{
					startIndex=i;
				}
				if(count>maxCount)
				{
					maxCount=count;
					maxStartIndex=startIndex;
				}
//				System.out.println("Count="+count);
//				System.out.println("MaxCount="+maxCount);
//				System.out.println("St.Index="+startIndex);
//				System.out.println("MaxSt.Index="+maxStartIndex);
			}else
			{
				//odd number found so count=0
				count=0;
			}
			
		}
		System.out.println();
		System.out.println(maxCount);
		System.out.println(maxStartIndex);
	}

}
-------------------------------

OOPs concepts, Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Interfaces, Composition, Overloading and Overriding, 
--------------------------------------
Class and Object
Class is a blueprint of objects
Class is a data definition
or type definition
or composite type

Date is a class
	why is it necessary?
		because, we want to store day, month, year, hour, minute, seconds, am/pm, milliseconds etc in one object
		composite type
	it is created using the primitive data types only.

Conventions to be followed while creating a class:
	1) class name must be a noun
	2) class name must be in PascalCase, ie., first letter of every word in upper case.
		ex:
			NumberFormatException
			ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	3) in a java file	ie., Something.java,
		it is always recommended to have only 1 class
		if you have multiple classes coded in a single file, then
		only 1 of them can be public class.	The file name must be same as the public class in that file.

	4) class name should not be a person's name, or specific value and it should be an entity
		ex:
			Student
			Employee
			Department
				these are proper name of a class
			Raja
			Kumar
			Coimbatore
			ECE
				these are not proper class names. These can be object names

		Student is a class
		raja can be an object of student
	but 
		Student student=new Student();			//here "student" is object.
	
Object names must follow camelCase
		example:
			ContractEmployee contractEmployee=new ContractEmployee();
			//firstLetter is small letter and all other next word's first letters are in upper case.

	it is guidelines to be followed. Guidelines are not rules. 
	if you violate rules, you get error. 
	if you violate guidelines, you will not get any error

	i NEVER want to see a class name starting with lower case.

	class student		//THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE

	class main			//NOT OK

	class Student		//OK


	Student Raja;		//WHAT IS WRONG IN THIS?		object name starts in upper case is BAD

	In java, there are already so many built in classes. Look at them, they follow these guidelines.
	So, you also follow.

	
	student			you dont have any doubt, it is an object

	Student			you know it is a class	/ interface		type


	class can contain:
		data members
		methods

	data members
		variables
		constants

constants:
	final int i=20;			//this is a constant in java		"const" was used in c, c++
		you need to initialize a value to this variable when you create itself.

	in above final declaration, one guideline is not followed. A CONSTANT IN JAVA MUST BE IN FULL UPPER CASE

	final int I=20;
	final String COMPANY_NAME="Wipro";
		//now, why _ is used?		full  capital so we cant find multiple words clearly. so _ is used

	final datamembers are constants. cannot change their value or reference.

	public static final int MAX_VALUE=-2147483649;

	why they use static?

	Integer.MAX_VALUE
		I am referring the data member using class name (not object name)

a class can contain data members which are
		instance data member (or)
		static data members


class Employee
{
	int id;
	String name;
	static String final COMPANY_NAME="Wipro";
}	

	why static is used?
		if i create 5 objects of Employee,
			even then, for all employees, the company name is same.
		static member of a class is shared by all objects of the class.
		there exists only 1 instance (object) of company name

	
static
	can be used in 
		data member  of a class
		method of a class
		block 		static  block


	static cannot be used outside a class.
	static is inside a class
		in c, c++ a method (function) can contain a static variable.
		but in java, we cannot have a static data member inside a method.

		static means	=>	shared by all  objects of a class
		
	to access a static member, we can use <<classname>>.member name


	Integer.MAX_VALUE
