Arrays
--------
	what is an array?

your answers:
	collection of similar elements
	a set of similar data type
	hold a fixed number of values of a single type
	multiple values of the same type
	datastructure that stores data
	linear data structure
	indexed datastructure

i understand that 
	we can store multiple values/ objects in an array
	when you say array contains elements of only 1 type
		every datastructure is like that only

	onething none of you told is that
		Array keeps elements in contiguous memory locations (continuous, adjacent)
Arrays can be single dimension or multi-dimension

in c, c++, arrays are created like below:
	int arr[10];

in Java:
	int []arr=new int[10];

	2 portions
		i) declaration
		ii) creation		(we need to know the size to create an array)


	new int[10];		i have created an array of type int of size 10
	but this array's reference is not stored in any variable. So it cannot be used later.
------------------------------------------------------------
	int arr[];			//i have declared an array of single dimension of type int.
				//but an array is not yet created.

	arr=new int[10];		//an array is created and its reference is kept in variable "arr"

------------------------------------------------------------
the same can be done in single line also:
	int []arr=new int[10];


	the declaration decides the scope of the variable. 	
	if you declare a variable before for loop, then it is used before and inside and outside for loop
	but if you declare a variable inside for loop, then it is used only inside for loop
		not only for loop, any block		{	}
		scope of the variable is within the block only.

	so we can declare an array earlier
	and then create it later (when we come to know how many elements)


Demo:
Sample Input :
11
2
16
15
2
6
8
10
7
22
4
6


the first input mentions the number of elements in the array
in above example, 11 is the size of the array

if first input is x,
then x number of inputs must be captured from the user.

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class App {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int arr[]=new int[n];
		//get n inputs from the user and store them in arr
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
		}
		
		System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
	}

}

In arrays, 
	we can access any element using its id

	arr[0] refers to the first element of the array

	if the length of the array is n
	then arr[n-1] refers to the last element of the array


	we can find the length of the array using
		arr.length		property

	for example, how will you print all elements of an array?
		i) for loop 
		ii) for each loop
		iii) Arrays.toString(arr) 
			Arrays.deepToString(arr)	if arr is multi dimensional
			these methods were introduced in jdk 1.5 only.	means, jdk 1.4 or earlier do not have 


	Arrays in java are always Jagged arrays
	what is meant by jagged array?
		Jagged means uneven
	ex:
		int arr[][]=new int[10][];		//if you consider first dimension as row and second as column
		we have created 10 rows and each row can be of different number of columns.

		arr[0]	refers to the first row		you can see that arr[0] is a single dimensional array


	arr[][]	is like array of arrays

		arr[0]=new int[10];			//first row is having 10 columns
		arr[1]=new int[5];			//second row has 5 columns
		arr[2]=new int[7];			//third row has 7 columns

	this is what we call it as Jagged array.

	if you do not want jagged array, then you want all rows to have same number of columns
		int arr[][]=new int[10][5];		//all rows have same number of columns. Not jagged

	int i=20;
	when you see i is primitive type
	int arr[]=new int[10];		//is complete
	Date d=new Date();
		d is object type

	for objects we need to use new operator



	Date dob;		//this is incomplete
	dob=new Date();	//it is complete now.

	similarly
	Date []dt=new Date[10];			//this is incomplete
	dt[0]=new Date();
	dt[1]=new Date();
	...
	...
	...
	dt[9]=new Date();		

Task:
create an array of size 10
accept 10 inputs from the user and store them in the array
find the largest element and smallest element of the array.
print them as output.


Challenge:
----------------
Run Length IV
 
Write a program to find the length of the longest running sequence of even numbers in the given array. Also find the starting index of the longest running sequence of even numbers.
 
Example :
 
Consider the array ... { 2, 16, 15, 2, 6, 8, 10, 7, 22, 4 , 6}
 
The 3 even number sequences in this array are {2, 16}, {2, 6, 8, 10} and {22, 4, 6}.
The longest running even number sequence is {2, 6, 8, 10}
The length of the longest running even number sequence is 4 and the starting index is 3.
 
Note:
The array indexing starts from 0.
If there are multiple choices, select the choice where the starting index is minimum.
 
Input and Output Format:
 
The first line of the input consists of an integer n that corresponds to the number of elements in the array. The next 'n' lines of input consists of a single integer that correspond to the elements in the array.
 
The first line of the output consists of the length of the longest running even number sequence and the second line of the output consists of the starting index of the longest running even number sequence.
 
Sample Input :
11
2
16
15
2
6
8
10
7
22
4
6
 
Sample Output :
4
3
