Javascript
	Javascript is the most important part of our frontend

Javascript is a client side scripting language, means, it is executed in the browser.
Browsers are capable of restricting javascript so, you may need to ask user to enable javascript. But mostly it is enabled by default, unless somebody change the settings.

we can run a javascript program alone using nodejs.
if nodejs is installed in your system, then we can run a javascript program in cmd prompt

check if nodejs is installed in a computer:

C:\Users\rjaga>node --version
v21.0.0

C:\Users\rjaga>

in cloud lab, nodejs is installed.


i have created a file "one.js"
var x=20;
x++;
console.log(x);

in cmd prompt where one.js is present:

node one.js

i got output as 
21



we can also run javascript program in browser
for that, i create one.html
in that html page, i reference the one.js

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="one.js">
        
    </script>
</body>
</html>

open one.html in browser, 
the output will not be displayed in the browser, but in console.
so right click browser and inspect
	choose "console" tab
see the output there 


---------------------------------------------
data types in javascript
	we declare any variable using "var"
		var i=20;
		var x="Hello world";
		var d=new Date();

	javascript infers the datatype or type based on the value assigned to the variable.
There are data types in javascript even if we do not mention while declaring a variable.

Task:
Identify the data types in javascript.

Task:
identify the programming constructs in javascript
	if
	if else
	if else if else
	switch case
	while loop
	can we use do while loop in javascript
	for loop
	for each loop		(for arrays)
		2 types of foreach
		for of
		for in

Task:
Identify how to create and use arrays in javascript
and very important methods of Arrays in javsacript
	slice
	splice
