MCQ practise test
------------------------
GIT mcq discussion is over.
Now, lets start checking your readiness for Java.

1) What is the size of long data type?	8 bytes
2) Which loop executes atleast once?	do while loop
3) How do you find the size of an array?	length property		int i=arr.length;
4) How do you find the length of a String?	length method		int i=str.length();
5) Which method of String is used to check if the string is present as per a regular expression?
				matches()			str.matches("[0-9]{10}")
6) Which of the following is synchronized?
	HashMap
	TreeMap
	StringBuilder
	StringBuffer
				ans: StringBuffer
7) Which of the following is synchronized?
	StringBuilder
	HashMap
	Hashtable
	LinkedList
				ans: Hashtable
8) Which of the following is synchronized?
	ArrayList
	Vector
	HashSet
	TreeSet
				ans: Vector
so, find all the synchronized classes:
	Stack
	Vector
	Hashtable
	StringBuffer	(is not collection. but synchronized)

9) which keyword is used to ignore the property while synchronization?
	transient
10) which keyword is used to ensure that a variable is thread-safe.
	volatile
		this will ensure that the threads will not cache this variable. everytime, threads take value from primary memory
11) what is thread synchronization?
	ensures that when multiple threads try to access a shared object at a time, they are allowed one by one
		synchronized(this)
		synchronized(obj)

12) what are the purpose of these method, related to thread?
	notify()
	notifyAll()
	yield()
	join()
	start()

13) IO
	you need to know about the classes:
		FileInputStream
		FileOutputStream
		FileReader
		FileWriter
		BufferedReader
		BufferedWriter
		BufferedInputStream
		BufferedOutputStream
		ObjectInputStream
		ObjectOutputStream
		DataInputStream
		DataOutputStream

14) What is a functional interface?
		an interface that contains only one abstract method
			Comparator, Runnable, Predicate
		we can use lambda for providing quick implementation of a functional interface
15) What is a marker interface?
		an interface that contains no abstract method.
		ex:	Serializable
16) What is method reference?	
		ability to utilize the methods of any class as an implementation of a functional interface
	what is static method reference?

17) Difference between
		java.util.Date
		java.sql.Date
		java.time.LocalDate
		java.time.LocalTime

18) Collections:
	Collections.sort()	works only for List category 
	ListIterator	works only for List category
	List maintains the order of the elements
	List allows duplicates. Any number of null

	Set rejects duplicates
	Set order is based on the type of the Set. 
		LinkedHashSet is ordered. it maintains the append order



public class MyClass {
long var;
public void MyClass(long param) { var = param; } // (Line no 1)
public static void main(String[] args) {
MyClass a, b;
a = new MyClass(); // (Line no 2) 
}
}



boolean b = TRUE;			//TRUE is invalid.		true is valid
byte b = 256;			//range of byte is -128 to 127	
String s = “null”;			//valid
int i = new Integer(“56”);		//valid		constructor can accept String and return int


-----------------
1) MCQ test
2) Coding test
	coding test IMO is always core java test
