Introduction to Microservices
Monolith Application
Netflix OSS & Spring Cloud
Client-Side Circuit Breakers – Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker with Resilience4J, Other Spring Cloud Projects
Event Driven Microservices with Apache Kafka

Milestone 3 assessment planned tomorrow 05-Jul-2024

Understand and appreciate the architecture of Microservice, 
Understand and appreciate the 12 Factor methodology and its implications on the Microservices architecture, 
Implement Microservices using Spring Boot framework, 
Refactor Monolithic application into Micro services based Application, 
Setup Service Registry and register Micro services and enable discovery pattern, 
Build scalable Microservices and implement client-side load balancing, 
Implement fault-tolerance services using circuit breakers, 
Set up centralized configuration with Spring Cloud Config Server and client, 
Apply the API gateway pattern through Spring Cloud Gateway and setup routes, 
Manage distributed log tracing with Spring cloud Sleuth and zipkin, 
Understand and apply Spring Security – basic auth, CORS, 
Understand and implement Event driven Microservices with Apache Kafka.

API Gateway
CORS		cross origin resource sharing

we will use CORS when we learn react
from ReactJs application, we will access the REST apis
	but that is normally restricted since react origin is different from rest api
	1) we will add @CrossOrigin annotation in our controller and specify the pattern / url from which we allow access
	2) when we use spring security, we will also enable CORS in security configuration		http.cors()



Kafka is useful for publisher/subscriber model
	where, the clients subscribe for the topic
	and the publisher publishes to topic
	whoever subscribed get update from the topic

If you are doing a ticket booking portal project,
then you will be showing trailers and trailers show a button "I am interested".
The movie is currently in "coming soon" status.
Once the movie has got release date and the ticket booking is open now,
we must notify all those who "shown interest" in that movie, so that they can come and book the ticket.

MCQ
Coding challenge

8, 10, 17, 4, 6, 2, 11, 13

what is the maximum product of any 2 numbers and that number is present in this list.

find the product of every 2 number
take 1st number and multiply it by all other numbers right side
take 2nd number and multiply it with all other numbers right side
 
everytime you get a product
check if the product is found as an element in this list?
	yes means,
		check this with maxProduct variable
			if this product is > max then
				update max

at the end of the loop,
	max will contain the answer





for loop to print each element of the list
8
10
17

create inner loop to get the second operand of product

8 17
8 10
